Story of SÃ¶ll was the first game project made in Unity and without prior coding knowledge.
Some code here is written with the assistance of youtube tutorials, especially the CharacterController2D script.
The ScoreManager (Singleton) and Worm scripts are used to keep track of the score and display it ingame.
The enemy_movement and patrolowl script are used to move the enemies and make them patrol a horizontal area.
