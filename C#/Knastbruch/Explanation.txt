Knastbruch / Prison Break was my first "real" Unity project with coding. The game was developed in under three
days for a GameJam with the theme "light".

AnimateRiver: A simple way to animate a Spritesheet through code.
AudioManager: An AudioManager to play and stop sounds / background music.
CharacterControllerPrison:  The character controller for the main character that also handles 
                            animation, death and sounds.
FishBehaving: Simple script to make an object move from left to right using sin.
MoveSpotlight: Handles the movement of the spotlights from point A to B in a group of positions.
PauseMenu: A pause menu using the Unity Engine's scene management.
SpotlightFade:  The SpotlightFade script handles the transparency fade of every game object with the script.
                If a game object is outside of a spotlight cone, it is not visible and the closer it is
                to the spotlight, the more visible the game object becomes.
