venia\But what if a Leviathan approaches?
venia\He can't possibly survive that alone!
volvo\...
volvo\Do you know his story, Venia?
venia\I heard from the others but never from Maro.
volvo\Years ago the pirate crew 'Deep Dive' died at sea.
volvo\A Leviathan attacked them on their voyage.
venia\I heard it attacked during daytime?
volvo\Which is uncommon for Leviathane.
volvo\Lazelians kept saying that the crew was cursed.

volvo\'They must have angered the gods'
venia\And Maro was part of that crew?
volvo\He still is to this date.
volvo\The only surviving member that is.
volvo\Which in itself is a miracle.
venia\Why are you telling me all this?

volvo\Death is the only way to calm his soul.
