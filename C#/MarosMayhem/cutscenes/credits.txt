maro\What is wrong?
venia\You were gone for a full week!
venia\We were worried sick about you.
maro\I told you last time already.
maro\Don't bother.
volvo\Maro.
maro\...?
volvo\The family has decided on an expedition date.
volvo\It will be in three days, are you coming?
maro\You know the answer already.
maro\Unless we go beyond floor 70, I am not coming.
venia\Can you join us just this one time?
venia\We need you to cover our backs.
venia\Volvo alone won't be able to.
maro\I gave you my answer.
maro\So shut up already.
venia\...
volvo\Be friendly with your sister.
maro\Sister?
maro\I don't remember having family.
volvo\Don't say that Maro. We are all family.
volvo\It may not be by blood, but we are connected.
maro\Stop throwing around those superficial terms.
maro\Stop pretending that you are family.
maro\It sickens me just thinking about it.
volvo\Maro!
maro\If you want me to come with you...
maro\... it will have to be by force.
volvo\Take back what you just said!
maro\Make me.
venia\It is fine Volvo.
venia\Let's go back.
venia\He is beyond reasoning.

none\"Ever since the war, my grip on him loosened...
none\I tried my best to put him on the right path.
none\Where did I go wrong?
none\Was it the first human he killed?
none\The one time I didn't have him on a leash?
none\Or was taking him in the mistake...?
none\The other families are scared of him.
none\Our own family is terrified around him.
none\They all saw the beast within.
none\...
none\I was hoping the day would never come.
none\Where I will have to raise my hand...
none\... and put down my own child again."
