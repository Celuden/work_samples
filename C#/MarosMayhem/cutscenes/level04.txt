none\"Today I saved a child from drowning.
none\His heart had already stopped beating.
none\What else was I supposed to do?
none\I had to save him!
none\I couldn't let him die.
none\...
none\He now carries my blessing.
none\May he repay me by helping humankind."

maro\What is wrong?
venia\You were gone for a full week!
venia\We were worried sick about you.
maro\I told you last time already.
maro\Don't bother.
volvo\Maro.
maro\...?
volvo\The family has decided on an expedition date.
volvo\It will be in three days, are you coming?
maro\You know the answer already.
maro\Unless we go beyond floor 70, I am not coming.
venia\Can you join us just this one time?
venia\We need you to cover our backs.
venia\Volvo alone won't be able to.
maro\I gave you my answer.
maro\So shut up already.
venia\...
volvo\Be friendly with your sister.
maro\Sister?
maro\I don't remember having family.
volvo\Don't say that Maro. We are all family.
volvo\It may not be by blood, but we are connected.
maro\Stop throwing around those superficial terms.
maro\Stop pretending that you are family.
maro\It sickens me just thinking about it.
volvo\Maro!
maro\If you want me to come with you...
maro\... it will have to be by force.
volvo\Take back what you just said!
maro\Make me.
venia\It is fine Volvo.
venia\Let's go back.
venia\He is beyond reasoning.
volvo\...
none\End of Memo.
