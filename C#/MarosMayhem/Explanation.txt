Maro's Mayhem is one of my first coding projects and thus the classes have a lot of hard-coded
variables and are way too bloated in some cases.
But the classes in this repo, especially the EnemyManager class, play around with reading in
the enemy spawns from a text file (found in SpawnData) and thus can elegantly spawn in enemies.
This could have been remade into random spawns with ease - but in the MMP1 there was a rather strict
deadline which is why the enemies are always spawned in at fixed intervals and locations.
The CutsceneManager also reads in cutscenes from the cutscenes folder and displays them ingame depending
on which level is played / chosen.
