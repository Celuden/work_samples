For our multiplayer game Knock-Off Heroes I implemented the software design strategy pattern for using 
different special abilities for each character and loading them in with corresponding components.
I also implemented a RigidBodyComponent, BoxCollisionComponent, PlayerMove and PlayerAttack component 
for our game project.
